due April 4, Monday

1.  Write a program to solve problem 1 of Quiz 3.  You should
implement a dynamic programming solution.  You may memoize or do a
bottom up solution.

tspassignment.cpp in this directory gives a code fragment that you
should use.  This enables you to read in the points graphically, and
sets up the distance matrix.  At the end there is code which shows how
to draw lines to show the path you will find.  Use only 10 points,
since the time taken increases exponentially.

The shortest path between the second last and last points is to be
found, passing exactly once through all other points.

2.  Consider problem 2 of Chapter 8 of KT.  Show that diverse subset
reduces to Independent Set.

3.  A subset E' of edges in a graph is said to be a matching if no two
edges in E' is incident on the same vertex.  Write an ILP to determine
the maximum matching in a graph, i.e. a matching of maximum size.

4.  Let u,v denote the values at the inputs and w the value at the
outputs of an OR gate.  Derive a CNF formula that is true iff w is the
OR of u,v.
