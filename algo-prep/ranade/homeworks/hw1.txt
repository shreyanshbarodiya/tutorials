1.  Show that the sum of i^3log i summed from i=1 to i=n is
    theta(n^4 log n).

2.  Consider the sum S(n) of a geometric series

    S(n) =  a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1}

    Show that if r<1, then S(n)=theta(F), if r>1, then S(n)=theta(L),
    where F=a and L=ar^{n-1} are the first and the last terms of the
    series.  Assume a,r are constants, i.e. independent of n.

3.  An example of divide and conquer is binary search.  You have seen
    how to use binary search to search in a sorted array.  Here is
    another problem where it is useful.  Suppose you are given in
    clockwise order the vertices p_1, p_2, ..., p_n of a convex
    polygon P.  You are also given another point q and you want to
    determine whether q lies inside P.  Show that this can be done in
    O(log n) time.

    For this you may note that if a convex polygon is partitioned by a
    straight line both parts remain convex.  You can prove this (but
    are not required to do so) using the definition of convexity: a
    set is convex if the straight line joining any two points in the
    set is contained in the set.

4.  Write a program to read n pairs of numbers with arbitrary number
    of digits and print their products.  Your input file should have n
    on the first line, and each number on a new line, for a total of
    2n+1 lines.  You should print the products, each on a separate
    line (do not print n).  Instructions for submitting the program
    will be given soon.
