2.  Problem 4 of Ch 6 of KT.

3.  Problem 8 of Ch 6 of KT.

4.  Problem 19 of Ch 6 of KT.

Your writeup should generally have the following form:

* A recurrence describing the cost.  State which value you are finally
  interested in.  The base cases.  Clearly explain the notation.

* A justification for the recurrence (proof)

* Analysis of the time taken to solve the recurrence.

* Description of how you would find the optimal solution and not just
  its cost/benefit.

Do NOT submit a recursive algorithm.
